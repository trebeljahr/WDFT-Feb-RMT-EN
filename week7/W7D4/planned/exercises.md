## Hooks for fetching data:
1. Create a create-react-app using npx.
1. Make a simple component and use it in your app.
1. Add a state variable that can hold the data for a Rick and Morty character, which we will fetch from the API...
1. Use the useEffect hook to fetch your favorite character from the Rick and Morty API. https://rickandmortyapi.com/
1. Display name, image, and a list of all the episodes the character appears in.
1. Bonus: Display a `Loading...` text until the data from the API has loaded.
1. EXTRA Bonus: Have an input field and a button to control/change which character is fetched.

## Hooks for setInterval:
1. Create a CRA using npx.
1. Create a "Timer" component that displays a number and then increases that number by 1 every second.
1. Can you make the time configurable, so that you can have a timer that tick up at different intervals?
1. Now display 5 timers - one that ticks up every 1 second, one that ticks up every 2 seconds, every 3 seconds and so on.
1. BONUS: Can you display 100 timers like that? 
   Hint: If you structured your code "good", this should be as easy as editing a single number
   Fun-Fact: You can create an array of the numbers 1-100 like so: Array.from(Array(100)).map((_,i)=>i+1)
